# Movie Recommender System using Deep Learning

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code for a Movie Recommender System.  It consists of three main components:

1. **Data Collection**: The initial step involves downloading movie datasets ('tmdb_5000_movies.csv' and 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv'). 

2. **Deep Learning Model**: The project includes a neural network-based deep learning model. 

3. **Streamlit Web App**: The code integrates the machine learning model into a user-friendly web app using Streamlit.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:

   - Download the datasets ('tmdb_5000_movies.csv' and 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv') and save them in the project directory.

   - Run the provided Python script to preprocess the data and calculate movie similarity.

2. **Deep Learning Model**:

   - The deep learning algorithm used in the project is a neural network.
  
   - The model uses the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  
   - The model's accuracy is evaluated, and a confusion matrix assesses its performance.
  
3. **Streamlit Web App**:

   - Install required libraries, including Streamlit, and run the Streamlit script.

   - Users can open the web app in a browser, select a movie, and receive recommendations.

## Streamlit in Simple Words

- Streamlit is a Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.

- In this project, Streamlit makes it easy for users to select movies and receive recommendations in a user-friendly web app.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project for your movie recommendation needs!
